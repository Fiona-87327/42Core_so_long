# so_long
so_long is a small 2D puzzle/game project: control a player on a character map to collect all collectibles and reach the exit. The program (`so_long`) must validate the map, render it, and allow the player to move using keyboard controls.
Common dependencies:
- libft — your custom C utility library
- MLX42 — or another MiniLibX-compatible graphics library
- System libraries (e.g. GLFW/OpenGL). Exact requirements vary by platform and must be installed separately.
